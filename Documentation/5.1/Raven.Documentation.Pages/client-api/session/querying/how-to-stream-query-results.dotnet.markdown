# Stream Query Results

---

{NOTE: }

* RavenDB supports __streaming data__ from the server to the client.  
  Streaming is useful when processing a large number of results.

* The data streamed can be a result of a dynamic query, a static index query,  
  or just filtered by a prefix.  

* Neither the client nor the server holds the full response in memory.   
  Instead, as soon as the server has a __single result__, it sends it to the client,  
  Thus, your application can start processing results before the server sends them all.

* The stream results are __not tracked__ by the session.  
  Changes made to them will not be sent to the server when _SaveChanges_ is called.

* The stream results are a __snapshot of the data__ at the time when the query is computed by the server.  
  Results that match the query after it was already processed are not streamed to the client.

* Streaming query results does not support using [include](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load-with-includes).  
  Learn how to __stream related documents__ here [below](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-stream-query-results#stream-related-documents).

* To stream results, use the `Stream` method from the `Advanced` session operations.

#### Stream related documents

---

__Why streaming query results does not support 'include'__:

* A document can reference [related documents](../../../indexes/indexing-related-documents#what-are-related-documents).
* An [include](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load-with-includes) clause in a non-streamed query loads these related documents to the session  
  so that they can be accessed without an additional query to the server.
* Those included documents are sent to the client at the end of the query results.  
  This does not mesh well with streaming, which is designed to allow transferring massive amounts of data,  
  possibly over a significant amount of time.

__How to stream related documents__:

* Instead of using _include_, define the query so that it will return a [projection](../../../indexes/querying/projections).
* The projected query results will not be just the documents from the queried collection.  
  Instead, each result will be an entity containing the related document entities in addition to the original queried document.
* On the client side, you need to define a class that matches the projected query result.

__Example__:

* The below example uses RawQuery.  
  However, the same logic can be applied to a Query, DocumentQuery, or when querying an index.
* Note:  
  The projected class in the example contains the full related documents.  
  However, you can project just the needed properties from the related documents.

####  Stream results by prefix

---

* Streamed data can also be filtered by an __ID prefix__ and by other __filtering options__, see syntax below.
* Note: No auto-index is created when streaming results by a prefix.
