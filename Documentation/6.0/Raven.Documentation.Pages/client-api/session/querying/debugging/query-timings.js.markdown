# Include Query Timings

---

{NOTE: }

* When running a query, you can request for statistics regarding 
  the time it takes to perform the whole query as well as parts 
  of it like the duration of document search and loading.  
* By default, this feature is **disabled**.  
  To **enable** it, add `include timings()` to an RQL query or call 
  `.timings()` from your code.  

* In this page:  
    * [Including Timings In a Query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/query-timings#including-timings-in-a-query)  
        * [Syntax](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/query-timings#syntax)  
        * [Example](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/query-timings#example)

{PANEL: Viewing Timings}

* Timings can be viewed using Studio's [Query view](../../../../studio/database/queries/query-view).  
* If `include Timings()` is added to an RQL query Studio will display an additional **Timings** tab 
  with a graphical representation of the time it took to perform each query part.

In a sharded database, timings are provided per shard.
