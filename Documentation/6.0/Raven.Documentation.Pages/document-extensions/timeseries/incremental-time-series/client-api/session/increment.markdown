# Session: Create & Modify Incremental Time Series

---

{NOTE: }

* Create and modify incremental time series and their entries using `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment`.  

* There is no need to explicitly create or delete a time series.  
   * A time series is created when its first entry is incremented.  
   * A time series is deleted when all entries are [deleted](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete) from it.  

* You can add a single [incremental time series entry](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/design#time-series-entries) at a time.  
  Note, however, that you can `Increment` as many times as you need to before calling 
  `session.SaveChanges`, to create multiple entries in a single transaction.  

* In this page:  
      * [`IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment`](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/incremental-time-series/client-api/session/increment#timeseriesfor.append)  
         * [Syntax](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/incremental-time-series/client-api/session/increment#syntax)

{PANEL: `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment`}

* `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment` is used for the creation of incremental time series and 
  their entries, and for the modification of entry values.  
   * **Creating a new Incremental Time Series**  
     Incrementing entry values for an incremental time series that doesn't exist yet will 
     create the new incremental time series with this entry.  
   * **Creating an Incremental Time Series Entry**  
     Incrementing an entry value for an entry that doesn't exist yet will add the entry to 
     this series at the specified timestamp.  
   * **Modifying Entry Values**  
     Increment a value for an existing entry by a number of your choice.  

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Syntax}

* There are four `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment` methods:  
   * Increment a time series entry's array of values at the provided timestamp.   
     {CODE incremental_declaration_increment-values-array-at-provided-timestamp@DocumentExtensions\TimeSeries\IncrementalTimeSeriesTests.cs /}
   * Increment a time series entry's array of values at the current time.  
     {CODE incremental_declaration_increment-values-array-at-current-time@DocumentExtensions\TimeSeries\IncrementalTimeSeriesTests.cs /}
   * Increment an entry value at the provided timestamp.  
     (If the entry exists and has more than one value, only the first 
     value in its list will be incremented by the passed value.)  
     {CODE incremental_declaration_increment-value-at-provided-timestamp@DocumentExtensions\TimeSeries\IncrementalTimeSeriesTests.cs /}
   * Increment an entry value at the current time.  
     (If the entry exists and has more than one value, only the first 
     value in its list will be incremented by the passed value.)  
     {CODE incremental_declaration_increment-value-at-current-time@DocumentExtensions\TimeSeries\IncrementalTimeSeriesTests.cs /}

* **Parameters**  

    | Parameters | Type | Description |
    |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
    | `timestamp` | DateTime | Time series entry's timestamp |
    | `values` | IEnumerable<double> | A list of delta values to increment the entry values by |
    | `value` | double | The delta to increment the entry value by |

* **Exceptions**  
  If the document doesn't exist, a `DocumentDoesNotExistException` exception is thrown.

{PANEL: Usage Flow}

* Open a session  
* Create an instance of `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor` and pass it:  
    * An explicit document ID,  
      -or-  
      An [entity tracked by the session](../../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities), 
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.Query](../../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query) 
      or from [session.Load](../../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load).  
    * The time series name.  
      The name **must** begin with "INC:" (can be upper or lower case) to identify the time series as incremental.  
* Call `IncrementalTimeSeriesFor.Increment`.  
* Call `session.SaveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.

{PANEL: Code Samples}

* Increment an array of values in an incremental time series entry.  
  {CODE incremental_create-incremental-time-series@DocumentExtensions\TimeSeries\IncrementalTimeSeriesTests.cs /}
    * If the time series doesn't exist, it will be created with this first entry.  
    * If the entry doesn't exist, it will be created with the provided values.  
    * If the entry exists, its values will be increased by the provided values.  
       * a negative number will decrease the current value.
