# Document Extensions: Time Series
---

{NOTE: }

* **Time series** are sets of numeric data items, associated with timestamps and ordered 
  by time.  
* The studio interface allows you to edit, query and index time series data, as well as 
  view it as a list of entries or as a graph.  
* An **Incremental Time Series** is a special type of time series that allows you to 
  handle time series values as counters.  
  Read more about incremental time series [here](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/incremental-time-series/overview), 
  and learn how to define them through Studio [below](../../../studio/database/document-extensions/time-series#incremental-time-series).

### Create new Time Series (by Creating its First Entry)

* A time series is created upon the creation of its first entry (and deleted 
  once all entries have been deleted).  

* Click the **Add Time Series** button from the 
  [Document View](../../../studio/database/document-extensions/time-series#document-view) 
  to create the time series' first entry.  

![Add Time Series](images/time-series/new-time-series.png "Add Time Series")

---

![Add Time Series Entry](images/time-series/new-entry.png "Add Time Series Entry")

{WARNING: }

1. **Time Series Type**  
    * **Diasble** to create a **non-incremental time series**.  
      (Learn now to create an incremental time series [here](../../../studio/database/document-extensions/time-series#incremental-time-series))  
2. **Time Series Name**  
    * Enter time series' name.  
    * Name cannot start with 'INC:' as this prefix is reserved for incremental time series.  
3. **Entry Timestamp**  
    * Select a [timestamp](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/overview#timestamps) for the new entry.  
4. **Tag** (Optional)  
    * Optionally give the entry a [tag](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/overview#tags).
5. **Values**  
    * Add one or more numerical [values](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/overview#values) (up to 32 values).  
      ![Named Values](images/time-series/named-values.png "Named Values")
    * Time series entry values can be given meaningful names rather than labels like Value #0 and Value #1.  
      To set entry values' names, use Studio's [Time Series Settings View](../../../studio/database/settings/time-series-settings#add-or-edit-time-series-configuration).

![Delete Range](images/time-series/delete-range.png "Delete Range")

{WARNING: }

To specify a range of time series entries:  

1. **Start Date**  
   Check **Use minimum** to use the first entry's timestamp as the start of the range,  
2. **End Date**  
   Check **Use maximum** to use the last entry's timestamp as the end of the range.  

---

* For either option, you can click the input bar and specify some other date in the 
  date & time dialog shown below.

    {NOTE: }
     Make sure that the time series Name is placed within double quotes (e.g. "StockPrices", 
     "INC:Downloads", etc.), so special characters like ":" would not interfere with the query.  
    {NOTE/}
   

2. Click to run the query.

{PANEL: Incremental Time Series}

* **Incremental Time Series** are time series whose values 
  behave as [counters](../../../document-extensions/counters/overview).  

* Similar to Counters, an incremental-time-series value can be increased/decreased by some 
  delta on any node.  
  Each node manages and stores its own accumulated local changes per value.  

* Simultaneous updates to the same value from multiple nodes do not create any conflict.  
  The value's total contents is simply the accumulation of that value's contents stored 
  per node in the cluster for the same timestamp.  

* This is opposed to non-incremental time series, where a value that is modified 
  is intended to replace the existing value's contents on all other nodes.  

* learn more in [Incremental Time Series -vs- Non-incremental Time Series](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/incremental-time-series/overview#incremental-time-series--vs--non-incremental-time-series).

{WARNING: }

1. **Show values per node**  
    * Enable to view the value's contents distribution per cluster node (see below).  
      When disabled, only the total value (the value's total contents) is visible.  
2. **Values**  
    * **Total Value**  
      This is the value's total contents, which is the accumulation of this value's contents from all cluster nodes.  
    * **Increment By**  
      The number you enter here is the **delta** that will be added to the value's 
      contents on the current node.  
      Enter a positive number to increase the value or a negative number to decrease it.  
      The change in the value's total contents will be visible after you click the Save button.

   Add an additional value (up to 32 values).  
4. **Save**  
   Click to save your changes.
