# TCP Compression
---

{NOTE: }

* With **TCP Compression** enabled, internal cluster data transfers 
  are compressed, including nodes' 
  [database replication](../server/clustering/replication/replication)
  and the data submitted by 
  [Data Subscriptions](../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions) 
  to their workers.  

* Especially on the cloud, the significant reduction in the amount of transferred 
  data translates to a significant reduction of costs.

{PANEL: TCP Compression}

RavenDB offers a variety of compression tools, including the compression 
of [stored documents](../server/storage/documents-compression) and 
[backups](../server/ongoing-tasks/backup-overview#compression).  

With the **TCP compression** feature enabled, data **in transit** is compressed as well.  

* RavenDB will compress data before [replicating](../server/clustering/replication/replication) 
  it from one cluster node to another.  
  Replication makes a large portion of a cluster's traffic, and compressing 
  replicated data will minimize the traffic volume and expedite data delivery.  

* [Data Subscriptions](../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions) 
  will also transfer compressed data to their workers.  
  Data subscriptions are used to automate documents processing, 
  and may transfer large quantities of documents on a regular basis. 
  Compressing the data they submit can reduce the traffic volume 
  and the costs of such automated routines considerably.  

## Compression Algorithm and Ratio

* TCP Compression uses the [Zstandard compression algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstandard), 
  continuously learning your data model to create dictionaries that represent the redundant 
  structural data across transferred documents.  

* Compression ratio tends to ascend as the size of the transferred data grows, 
  and may **top 85%** for big data transfers.  

## Enabling TCP Compression

Your server's [license](../start/licensing/licensing-overview) type determines whether 
TCP compression, among other features, is activated.  
No additional configuration is needed to enable this feature.

### Disabling TCP Compression

* TCP Compression can be disabled by a client, using the client API 
  DocumentStore `DocumentConventions.DisableTcpCompression ` convention.  
  {CODE DisableTcpCompression@Server\tcpCompression\tcpCompression.cs /}

* TCP Compression can also be disabled server-wide, using the 
  server [Server.Tcp.Compression.Disable](../server/configuration/server-configuration#server.tcp.compression.disable) configuration.  
  Learn how to change database settings using Studio [here](../studio/database/settings/database-settings).
