# Creating Sample Data


{NOTE: }

* Sample data can be created in playground databases to enable developers to experiment with features before making changes to their actual database.  
  It is populated with various collections, .json documents, indexes, and document extensions.  

* Many of the examples in the RavenDB documentation are based on this sample data.  
  Creating it will enable you to play with the data as you use the documentation to familiarize yourself with RavenDB features.  

* In this page:  
  * [Create Sample Data](../../../studio/database/tasks/create-sample-data#create-sample-data)

{PANEL: Create Sample Data}

* Sample data can be added only on an empty database.  

* To create sample data, you can either empty your playground database or [create a new database](../../../studio/database/create-new-database/general-flow).  
 
* If you plan to use [multiple nodes](../../../studio/database/create-new-database/general-flow#3.-configure-replication) 
   and/or [encryption](../../../studio/database/create-new-database/encrypted) in production, 
   we recommend installing your playground database in a similar environment.

 To create Sample Data:

  1. **Tasks** tab  
     Click to see task options.  
  2. **Create Sample Data**  
     Select to access the Sample Data screen.  
  3. **Create**  
     Click the **Create** button to generate the Northwind sample data.  
     Various collections, their documents and sample indexes will be created in your database.

![Figure 2. Documents View](images/Northwind-Documents-View.png "Documents View")

1. **Documents** tab  
   Click to open documents options.  
2. **Document Collections**  
   This is the first part of the auto-generated document `Id` string.  
    * In code, the `Id` string is all lowercase (e.g. `employees/5-A`).
3. **Document Ids**  
   Unique [document identification keys](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers).
4. **Collection**  
   Which [collection](../../../studio/database/documents/documents-and-collections) each document is in.  
5. **Document Extensions**  
   This column shows which types of document extensions are included in each document.
    * [Attachments](../../../document-extensions/attachments/what-are-attachments)
    * [Revisions](../../../server/extensions/revisions)
    * [Counters](../../../document-extensions/counters/overview)  
    * [Time Series](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/overview)

{PANEL: The Indexes Generated - Indexes View} 
    
![Figure 3. Indexes View](images/Northwind-Indexes-View.png "Indexes View")

1. **Index** tab  
   Click to view and modify current indexes.  
   * RavenDB's default [dynamic auto-indexes](../../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overview#index-types) are managed 
     automatically in response to queries.  
   * [Static Indexes](../../../indexes/creating-and-deploying) can also be set up manually.  
2. **List of Indexes**  
   Select to see the list of current indexes.  
3. **Query** this index.  
   A [general query](../../../studio/database/queries/query-view) automatically determines the best index to query and creates 
   new ones if a good index doesn't exist for that query.  
   Still, you can query specific indexes via the List of Indexes.  
4. **Edit** this index.  
   Indexes can be **modified via Studio**.  
   Read [Modifying Index Definition](../../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overview#modifying-index-definition) to learn more.
