# Documents Compression
---

{NOTE: }

* The __Documents Compression__ feature employs the Zstd compression algorithm  
  to achieve more efficient data storage with constantly improving compression ratios.  
  Learn more in this [overview](../../../server/storage/documents-compression#overview).

* Documents compression can be set for all collections, selected collections, and revisions.  
  Default compression settings are [configurable](../../../server/configuration/database-configuration#databases.compression.compressallcollectionsdefault). 

* When turned on, compression will be applied to:  
    * __New documents__:  
        * A new document that is saved will be compressed.  
    * __Existing documents__:  
        * Existing documents that are modified and saved will be compressed.  
        * Existing documents that are Not modified will only be compressed when executing the    
          [compact database operation](../../../client-api/operations/server-wide/compact-database#compaction-triggers-compression).

* From the Studio, go to __Settings__ > __Documents Compression__ to set compression for a particular database.  
  Compression can also be set from the [Client API](../../../server/storage/documents-compression).

* To see the contents and size details of your database storage go to the [Storage Report](../../../studio/database/stats/storage-report) view in the Studio.  

* In this page:  
  * [Set documents compression from Studio](../../../studio/database/settings/documents-compression#set-documents-compression-from-studio)
