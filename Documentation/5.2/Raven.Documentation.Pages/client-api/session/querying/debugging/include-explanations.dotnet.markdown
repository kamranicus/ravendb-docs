# Include Query Explanations

---

{NOTE: }

* When making a query, each document in the query results is assigned a __score__.  
  This score determines the order by which the documents come back in the results.

* Each document in the results includes this score under the `@index-score` property in its metadata.

* __To get the score details__ and see how it was calculated,  
  you can use `IncludeExplanations` when querying with a [DocumentQuery](../../../../client-api/session/querying/document-query/what-is-document-query). 

* In this page:
    * [Include explanations in query](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/include-explanations#include-explanations-in-query)  
    * [View explanations](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/include-explanations#view-explanations)  
    * [Syntax](../../../../client-api/session/querying/debugging/include-explanations#syntax)
