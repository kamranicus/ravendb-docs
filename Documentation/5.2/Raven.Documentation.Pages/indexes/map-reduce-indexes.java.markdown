# Indexes: Map-Reduce Indexes

Map-Reduce indexes allow you to perform complex aggregations of data. The first stage, called the map, runs over documents and extracts portions of data according to the defined mapping function(s).
Upon completion of the first phase, reduction is applied to the map results and the final outcome is produced.

The idea behind map-reduce indexing is that aggregation queries using such indexes are very cheap. The aggregation is performed only once and the results are stored inside the index.
Once new data comes into the database or existing documents are modified, the map-reduce index will keep the aggregation results up-to-date. The aggregations are never done during
querying to avoid expensive calculations that could result in severe performance degradation. When you make the query, RavenDB immediately returns the matching results directly from the index.

For a more in-depth look at how map reduce works, you can read this post: [RavenDB 4.0 Unsung Heroes: Map/reduce](https://ayende.com/blog/179938/ravendb-4-0-unsung-heroes-map-reduce).

{PANEL:Creating}

When it comes to index creation, the only difference between simple indexes and the map-reduce ones is an additional reduce function defined in index definition. 
To deploy an index we need to create a definition and deploy it using one of the ways described in the [creating and deploying](../indexes/creating-and-deploying) article.

### Example I - Count

Let's assume that we want to count the number of products for each category. To do it, we can create the following index using `LoadDocument` inside:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:LINQ map_reduce_0_0@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB:java:JavaScript map_reduce_0_0@Indexes\JavaScriptMapReduce.java /}
{CODE-TABS/}

and issue the query:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:Query map_reduce_0_1@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from 'Products/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

The above query will return one result for _Seafood_ with the appropriate number of products from that category.

### Example II - Average

In this example, we will count an average product price for each category. The index definition:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:LINQ map_reduce_1_0@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB:java:JavaScript map_reduce_1_0@Indexes\JavaScriptMapReduce.java /}
{CODE-TABS/}

and the query:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:Query map_reduce_1_1@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from 'Products/Average/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

### Example III - Calculations

This example illustrates how we can put some calculations inside an index using on one of the indexes available in the sample database (`Product/Sales`).

We want to know how many times each product was ordered and how much we earned for it. In order to extract that information, we need to define the following index:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:LINQ map_reduce_2_0@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB:java:JavaScript map_reduce_2_0@Indexes\JavaScriptMapReduce.java /}}
{CODE-TABS/}

and send the query:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:Query map_reduce_2_1@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from 'Product/Sales'
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{PANEL:Reduce Results as Artificial Documents}

#### Map-Reduce Output Documents

In addition to storing the aggregation results in the index, the map-reduce index can also output 
those reduce results as documents to a specified collection. In order to create these documents, 
called _"artificial",_ you need to define the target collection using the `outputReduceToCollection` 
property in the index definition.  

Writing map-reduce outputs into documents allows you to define additional indexes on top of them 
that give you the option to create recursive map-reduce operations. This makes it cheap and easy 
to, for example, recursively create daily, monthly, and yearly summaries on the same data.  

In addition, you can also apply the usual operations on artificial documents (e.g. data 
subscriptions or ETL).  

If the aggregation value for a given reduce key changes, we overwrite the output document. If the 
given reduce key no longer has a result, the output document will be removed.  

#### Reference Documents

To help organize these output documents, the map-reduce index can also create an additional 
collection of artificial _reference documents_. These documents aggregate the output documents 
and store their document IDs in an array field `ReduceOutputs`.  

The document IDs of reference documents are customized to follow some pattern. The format you 
give to their document ID also determines how the output documents are grouped.  

Because reference documents have well known, predictable IDs, they are easier to plug into 
indexes and other operations, and can serve as an intermediary for the output documents whose 
IDs are less predictable. This allows you to chain map-reduce indexes in a recursive fashion, 
see [Example II](../indexes/map-reduce-indexes#example-ii).  

Learn more about how to configure output and reference documents in the 
[Studio: Create Map-Reduce Index](../studio/database/indexes/create-map-reduce-index).  

### Artificial Document Properties  

#### IDs

The identifiers of **map reduce output documents** have three components in this format:  

`<Output collection name>/<incrementing value>/<hash of reduce key values>`  

The index in [Example I](../indexes/map-reduce-indexes#example-i) might generate an output document 
ID like this:  

`DailyProductSales/35/14369232530304891504`  

* "DailyProductSales" is the collection name specified for the output documents.  
* The middle part is an incrementing integer assigned by the server. This number grows by some 
amount whenever the index definition is modified. This can be useful because when an index definition 
changes, there is a brief transition phase when the new output documents are being created, but the 
old output documents haven't been deleted yet (this phase is called 
["side-by-side indexing"](../studio/database/indexes/indexes-list-view#indexes-list-view---side-by-side-indexing)). 
During this phase, the output collection contains output documents created both by the old version 
and the new version of the index, and they can be distinguished by this value: the new output 
documents will always have a higher value (by 1 or more).  
* The last part of the document ID (the unique part) is the hash of the reduce key values - in this 
case: `hash(Product, Month)`.  

The identifiers of **reference documents** follow some pattern you choose, and this pattern 
determines which output documents are held by a given reference document.  

The index in [Example I](../indexes/map-reduce-indexes#example-i) has this pattern for reference documents:  

`sales/daily/{Date:yyyy-MM-dd}`

And this produces reference document IDs like this:

`sales/daily/1998-05-06`

The pattern is built using the same syntax as 
[the `StringBuilder.AppendFormat` method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder.appendformat). 
See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings) 
to learn about the date formatting in particular.  

#### Metadata

Artificial documents generated by map-reduce indexes get the following `@flags` in their metadata:  

{CODE-BLOCK:json}
"@flags": "Artificial, FromIndex"
{CODE-BLOCK/}

These flags are used internally by the database to filter out artificial documents during replication.  

### Syntax
The map-reduce output documents are configured with these properties of 
`IndexDefinition`:  

{CODE:java syntax_0@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **outputReduceToCollection** | `String` | Collection name for the output documents. |
| **patternReferencesCollectionName** | `String` | Optional collection name for the reference documents - by default it is `<outputReduceToCollection>/References`. |
| **patternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences** | `String` | Document ID format for reference documents. This ID references the fields of the reduce function output, which determines how the output documents are aggregated. The type of this parameter is different depending on if the index is created using [IndexDefinition](../indexes/creating-and-deploying#using-maintenance-operations) or [AbstractIndexCreationTask](../indexes/creating-and-deploying#using-abstractindexcreationtask). |

### Examples

#### Example I

Here is a map-reduce index with output documents and reference documents:  

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:java:LINQ map_reduce_3_0@Indexes\MapReduceIndexes.java /}
{CODE-TAB:java:JavaScript map_reduce_3_0@Indexes\JavaScriptMapReduce.java /}
{CODE-TABS/}

In the **LINQ** index example above (which inherits `AbstractIndexCreationTask`), 
the reference document ID pattern is set with a lambda expression:  

{CODE-BLOCK:java}
PatternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences = "sales/daily/{Date:yyyy-MM-dd}";
{CODE-BLOCK/}  

This gives the reference documents IDs in this general format: `sales/monthly/1998-05-01`. 
The reference document with that ID contains the IDs of all the output documents from the 
month of May 1998.  
<br/>
In the **JavaScript** index example (which uses `IndexDefinition`), 
the reference document ID pattern is set with a `String`:  

{CODE-BLOCK:javascript}
PatternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences ("sales/daily/{Date:yyyy-MM-dd})"
{CODE-BLOCK/}  

This gives the reference documents IDs in this general format: `sales/daily/1998-05-06`. 
The reference document with that ID contains the IDs of all the output documents from 
May 6th 1998.  

### Remarks

{INFO: Saving documents}

Artificial documents are stored immediately after the indexing transaction completes.

{INFO/}

{WARNING:Recursive indexing loop}

It's forbidden to output reduce results to the collection that:

- the current index is already working on (e.g. index on `DailyInvoices` collections outputs to `DailyInvoices`),
- the current index is loading a document from it (e.g. index has `LoadDocument(id, "Invoices")` outputs to `Invoices`), 
- it is processed by another map-reduce index that outputs results to a collection that the current index is working on (e.g. one index on `Invoices` collection outputs to `DailyInvoices`, another index on `DailyInvoices` outputs to `Invoices`)

Since that would result in the infinite indexing loop (the index puts an artificial document that triggers the indexing and so on), you will get the detailed error on attempt to create such invalid construction.

{WARNING/}

{WARNING:Existing collection}

Creating a map-reduce index which defines the output collection that already exists and it contains documents will result in an error. You need to delete all documents
from the relevant collection before creating the index or output the results to a different one.

{WARNING/}
