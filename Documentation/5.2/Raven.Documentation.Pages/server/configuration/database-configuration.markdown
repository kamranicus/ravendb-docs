{NOTE: }

* This article describes database configuration settings. 

* After editing & saving a configuration key, the change will only take effect __after__ the database is reloaded.  
  See [How to reload the database](../../studio/database/settings/database-settings#how-to-reload-the-database).

{WARNING: }
__Warning__:  
Do not modify the database settings unless you are an expert and know what you're doing.

{PANEL:Databases.QueryTimeoutInSec}

The time in seconds to wait before canceling a query.  
This timeout refers to queries and streamed queries.  

If a query exceeds the specified time, an *OperationCanceledException* will be thrown.  
For the streaming queries, the timeout is delayed every time a query result is pushed to the stream.  
The timeout will be exceeded only if no result is streamed within that time.

- **Type**: `int`
- **Default**: `300`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Databases.QueryOperationTimeoutInSec}

The time in seconds to wait before canceling a query related operation (patch/delete query).  
The timeout is delayed every time a query result is processed.  
The timeout will be exceeded only if no document is processed within that time.  

- **Type**: `int`
- **Default**: `300`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Databases.OperationTimeoutInSec}

The time in seconds to wait before canceling specific operations (such as indexing terms).

- **Default**: `300`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Databases.CollectionOperationTimeoutInSec}

The time in seconds to wait before canceling several collection operations  
(such as batch delete documents from Studio).  
If an operation exceeds the specified time, an *OperationCanceledException* will be thrown.

{PANEL:Databases.Compression.CompressAllCollectionsDefault}

on newly created databases.  
This does not prevent you from enabling this after the database is created.  

- **Type**: `bool`

- **Scope**: Server-wide only

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Databases.Compression.CompressRevisionsDefault}

Set whether [documents compression](../../server/storage/documents-compression) should be turned on by default for REVISIONS

It is useful to turn this option off if you are expected to run on very low end hardware.  
That does not prevent you from enabling this after the database is created.  

- **Type**: `bool`  
- **Default**: `true`  
- **Scope**: Server-wide only  

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Databases.ConcurrentLoadTimeoutInSec}

{PANEL:Databases.MaxConcurrentLoads}

Specifies the maximum amount of databases that can be loaded simultaneously.

{PANEL:Databases.PulseReadTransactionLimitInMb}

Number of megabytes occupied by encryption buffers (if database is encrypted) or mapped 32 bites buffers (when running on 32 bits) 
after which a read transaction will be renewed to reduce memory usage during long running operations like backups or streaming.  

- **Type**: `int`
- **Default**: The default value is determined by the amount of RAM on your machine:  
    * 32 bit platforms: `16 MB`  
    * Less than 4 GB RAM: `32 MB`  
    * Less than 16 GB RAM: `64 MB`  
    * Less than 64 GB RAM: `128 MB`  
    * More than 64 GB RAM: `256 MB`
